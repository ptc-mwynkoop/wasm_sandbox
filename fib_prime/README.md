I’m on windows, so you may have to make mods to some of this stuff to use it.
 
1. The wasm file is ready to run, you don’t have to compile the .c files.
 
2. I use python to run a local web server like this:
  ```python server.py```
 
3. Then open a browser and load http://localhost:9000
 
4. Then open the developer tools so you can see the browser console
 
5. Now click the ‘Go’ button and watch the console: you can see the Fibonacci calc runs more than once during the time the prime calculation completes.
